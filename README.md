firebase-zsh is a configurable plugin for Zsh to display the current working project or project alias when in a Firebase project directory or subdirectory. Never push to production accidentally again! 

Part of the [Awesome zsh plugins collection!](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins)

## Installation

Clone the repository into your oh-my-zsh plugin folder:

`git clone https://github.com/seqi/firebase-zsh ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/firebase`

Then add it to your list of plugins in your `~/.zshrc`

`plugins=(git firebase)`

Finally, add the plugin output to your prompt, by opening your theme and adding the firebase project.

For example, 

`PROMPT='%{$fg[cyan]%}%n%{$reset_color%}:$(git_prompt_info) %(!.#.$) '`

becomes

`PROMPT='%{$fg[cyan]%}%n%{$reset_color%}:$(firebase_project) $(git_prompt_info)%(!.#.$) '`

Restart Zsh for the changes to take effect.
